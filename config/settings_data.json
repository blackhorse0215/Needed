ALA needs to be converted into the DHA and EPA forms of Omega-3 in order to be used by the body. This conversion process is highly inefficient (often less than 1%), so it is important for mom and baby to consume DHA and EPA directly. Fatty fish and supplements are the two reliable dietary sources. Fish do not make the DHA and EPA, but instead bioaccumulate them from eating algae.<\/p>"

And, as an extra benefit, the phospholipids are a source of Choline, which works synergistically with DHA in the body.

              "answer": "Omega-3 is critical fat for before, during, and after pregnancy. You cannot make Omega-3, and must obtain it from diet or supplementation. There are three main types of Omega-3, ALA, DHA, and EPA. ALA is found in plants like chia seeds, flax seeds, and walnuts. ALA needs to be converted into the DHA and EPA forms of Omega-3 in order to be used by the body. This conversion process is highly inefficient (often less than 1%), so it is important for mom and baby to consume DHA and EPA directly. Fatty fish and supplements are the two reliable dietary sources. Fish do not make the DHA and EPA, but instead bioaccumulate them from eating algae."

And, research shows that up to 95% of women are deficient. Even if you are not deficient, the more Omega-3 in your diet the better you will feel, especially when you are building baby as ⅓ of his or her brain is made of Omega-3."

              "answer": "Liposomes are molecular structures found in nature, such as in breastmilk. Our liposomes pair Omega-3 with natural helper nutrients, including phospholipids from sunflowers. This pairing 1) facilitates near-perfect (90-95%) Omega-3 absorption, a 5x improvement over a standard pill and 2) protects the Omega-3 from harmful oxidation that leads to rancidity. And, as an extra benefit, the phospholipids are a source of Choline, which works synergistically with DHA in the body. Overall, liposomes ensure you and your baby to get more of the DHA and EPA you need."

Our 300mg of DHA conforms to the American Pregnancy Association per day recommendation. A 2:1 ratio of DHA to EPA allows us to provide multiple benefits for mom and baby, as DHA and EPA have different and often complementary physiological effects. And, as an added benefit to our Omega-3, the powder provides a good source of choline at 55mg. <br> \n\nWe recognize that some practitioners recommend higher dosages of Omega-3 for before, during and after pregnancy. Our clinical research suggests that most mamas and mamas-to-be do not need a higher dose than our product delivers, as our powder facilitates near-perfect (90-95%) Omega-3 absorption, a 5x improvement over a standard pill."

While DHA and EPA intake is the primary driver of your Omega-3 Index, your genes, overall health, and lifestyle can affect the Omega-3 Index response to dietary changes.

We recommend an Omega-3 Index target value of 8-12% because this is where most research indicates a positive effect.  Above 12% has not proven to be disadvantageous, but there is little research for high values. Research suggests up to 95% of women of childbearing age are failing to meet their Omega-3 needs.

Liposomes facilitate near-perfect nutrient absorption and protection. In our liposomes, individual molecules of the fat-soluble nutrient Omega-3 are dispersed within a single bilayer of phospholipids, sitting within one molecular width from the surface of the liposome. The structure, in size and molecular arrangement, mimics that of naturally occurring liposomes, such as in breastmilk. In this form, the body recognizes the nutrients as “ready” to enter the final stages of digestion and nutrient absorption, bypassing the multi-stage (and often incomplete) interaction with intestinal fluids that is otherwise needed to break down and repackage nutrients prior to absorption. The liposomes allow us to deliver an Omega-3 that’s 5x better absorbed by the body than a standard pill. In addition, our phospholipids are derived from sunflower lecithin, which breaks down into choline, a key nutrient which supports optimal utilization of Omega 3- DHA and EPA within the body. Our liposomes also protect the Omega-3 from harmful oxidation that leads to rancidity in many other Omega-3 supplements. Overall, our liposomes ensure you and your baby to get more of the nutrients you need."

They propose that women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant build a red blood cell (RBC) DHA value of at least 5% (of total RBC fatty acids). In the US, ~70% of women of childbearing age are likely below this 5% cut-off point.

They enrolled 126 women, of whom 118 completed the trial. Prenatal supplementation with EPA-rich fish oil significantly lowered certain maternal cytokine concentrations. However, supplementation with DHA-rich fish oil had no significant effect on maternal cytokine profiles. Neither had an effect on umbilical cord blood cytokine concentrations.

Lichen is a moss-like organism that exists as a composite of fungus and algae. It is an important part of the Arctic tundra ecosystem and grows \"extremely slowly\", less than a millimeter per year.

              "answer": "We offer an Iron bound to Glycine as Ferrous Bisglycinate Chelate (Ferrochel™) in 13.5mg capsules that allow you to more easily dose up or down as you need. \n\nFerrous Bisglycinate Chelate is a mineral chelate in which Iron is bound to two Glycine amino acid molecules. It is easily absorbed by the body and, unlike most other Iron forms, it minimizes constipation and gastric upset."

We also recommend taking only as much as you need (some mamas do not need to supplement), as too much supplemental Iron can generate oxidative stress and alter the gut microbiome. Talk to your health practitioner about testing your Iron status before, during, and after pregnancy, and supplement if you are falling short. Our Iron is bound to Glycine for better absorption and digestive comfort."

Together, we have selected nutrient forms of 24 vitamins and minerals that work best in the body, and dosages intended to help you thrive, not just survive. Most prenatals are designed to meet bare minimum needs, and often contain inadequate nutrient amounts and tough-to-absorb forms."

We also recommend taking only as much as you need (some mamas do not need to supplement), as too much supplemental Iron can generate oxidative stress and alter the gut microbiome. Talk to your health practitioner about testing your Iron status before, during, and after pregnancy, and supplement if you are falling short. Our Iron is bound to Glycine for better absorption and digestive comfort."

You’ll see that a number of nutrient dosages are quite unique including 550mg of Choline and 400mg of Magnesium. Powder is more easily absorbed into the body. There is no need for additives or coatings. And, it tastes great and is seamless to incorporate into daily meals, drinks, or snacks (like smoothies, protein bites, nut milks, and more)."

Lichen is a moss-like organism that exists as a composite of fungus and algae. It is an important part of the Arctic tundra ecosystem and grows \\\"extremely slowly\\\", less than a millimeter per year. For this reason, we prefer a “mind-fully made” D3 originally sourced from lanolin. It is allergen free, meaning no milk, egg, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, soy, and gluten. It is also free of GMOs, artificial colors, artificial flavors, preservatives, and other additives and fillers."

              "answer": "We are thoughtful about every ingredient we use, including our OTHER INGREDIENTS. Citric Acid: Citric acid exists in a variety of fruits and vegetables. We use citric acid to enhance flavor. We source our citric acid from a natural fermentation process, not the commonly used corn source. Medium Chain Triglycerides from Organic Coconut Oil: MCT oil delivers short chain fatty acids providing creaminess, while being easy to digest. This purified oil contains no allergens. Acacia Fiber: Acacia fiber is a type of soluble fiber harvested from the sap of the Acacia tree. It is well tolerated and supports the texture of the powder. Natural Vanilla Flavor: Delicious vanilla taste on its own, or a great base to add other flavors like cocoa or berry to suit your taste buds. Modified Tapioca Starch: Modified tapioca starch is a hydrolyzed starch from the roots of the cassava plant. It is included in one of our vitamins to aid mixability of the powder. We use tapioca to avoid starch sourced from corn or grains. Monk Fruit Extract: Monk fruit, or Lo Han Guo, is a small round fruit native to southern China. This fruit has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine. We use a small amount, about 0.6% by weight per serving, of 100% extract from the fruit to add a little sweetness to the powder. Monk fruit causes no blood sugar spike. (Be careful that many will claim to be using monk fruit, but mix it with erythritol or xylitol.) Cellulose and Cellulose Wax: Cellulose, the main constituent of plant cell walls and vegetable fibers, form beadlets to encapsulate our Vitamin C for optimal nutrient delivery and protection. Sunflower Oil: Sunflower oil is the oil pressed from the seeds of sunflower. One of our vitamins contains sunflower oil for stability. Overall, it makes up less than 0.2% of a serving by weight. Annatto: Annatto extracted from the seeds of the achiote tree provides the pink coloring of our Vitamin C beadlets."

We use nutrients forms that are most easily absorbed by the body, but because we set dosages to be fully supportive, the nutrient amounts may sometimes be more than you need. At our dosages, this is not harmful in any way, but just a guarantee you hit optimal amounts. Less is not more in our mind!"

We recommend pairing the Prenatal Multi with our Omega-3 powder, Collagen Protein, and Pre\/Probiotic to fully support you and baby before, during, and after pregnancy. Keeping the products separate allows us to maintain quality. For example, we find the Omega-3 (DHA + EPA) is compromised when taken out of the context (our liposomes keep the Omega-3 in their natural context) and mixed into a multivitamin"

However, Vitamin D levels of <50 nmol\/L (20 ng\/ml) was defined as deficient in this study, so many nursing moms may need to supplement with more Vitamin D to achieve optimal levels."

There are three main types of Omega-3, ALA, DHA, and EPA. ALA is found in plants like chia seeds, flax seeds, and walnuts. ALA needs to be converted into the DHA and EPA forms of Omega-3 in order to be used by the body. This conversion process is highly inefficient (often less than 1%), so it is important for you to consume DHA and EPA directly. Fatty fish and supplements are the two reliable dietary sources. Fish do not make the DHA and EPA, but instead bioaccumulate them from eating algae."

              "answer": "Omega-3 is critical fat for before, during, and after pregnancy. You cannot make Omega-3, and must obtain it from diet or supplementation. There are three main types of Omega-3, ALA, DHA, and EPA. ALA is found in plants like chia seeds, flax seeds, and walnuts. ALA needs to be converted into the DHA and EPA forms of Omega-3 in order to be used by the body. This conversion process is highly inefficient (often less than 1%), so it is important for mom and baby to consume DHA and EPA directly. Fatty fish and supplements are the two reliable dietary sources. Fish do not make the DHA and EPA, but instead bioaccumulate them from eating algae."

And, research shows that up to 95% of women are deficient. Even if you are not deficient, the more Omega-3 in your diet the better you will feel, especially when you are building baby as ⅓ of his or her brain is made of Omega-3."

              "title": "Why is the dosage set at 400mg DHA + 100mg EPA?",
              "answer": "We set our dosage in partnership with leading scientists and health practitioners across modalities (including MDs, NDs, nutritionists, Chinese medicine doctors, midwives, and other birth work professionals) based on research and in-practice experience. Our 400mg of DHA conforms to the American Pregnancy Association per day recommendation. A combination of DHA to EPA allows us to provide multiple benefits for mom and baby, as DHA and EPA have different and often complementary physiological effects. And, as an added benefit to our Omega-3+, the capsules provide a good source of Choline at 100mg plus Lutein and Zeaxanthin, which all work synergistically to support mama and baby.\nWe recognize that some practitioners recommend higher dosages of Omega-3 for before, during and after pregnancy which is why we suggest doubling the dose for a period of time if your levels are low."

We pared down our complete Prenatal Multi (eight capsules or powder) to just the essentials you and your baby need. Our Prenatal Multi Essentials is the most nourishing prenatal available in just three pills, with optimal nutrient forms and meaningful dosages of the critical nutrients. If you can, we suggest taking our Prenatal Multi at all stages. But, when our Prenatal Multi doesn’t fit your budget or routine, you will be better supported with our Prenatal Multi Essentials than almost any other prenatal on the market. Like our other products, we worked directly with practitioners who regularly test nutrient levels to select every nutrient form and dose."

We also recommend taking only as much as you need (some mamas do not need to supplement), as too much supplemental Iron can generate oxidative stress and alter the gut microbiome. Talk to your health practitioner about testing your Iron status before, during, and after pregnancy, and supplement if you are falling short. Our Iron is bound to Glycine for better absorption and digestive comfort."

Lichen is a moss-like organism that exists as a composite of fungus and algae. It is an important part of the Arctic tundra ecosystem and grows \"extremely slowly\", less than a millimeter per year. For this reason, we prefer a “mind-fully made” D3 originally sourced from lanolin. It is allergen free, meaning no milk, egg, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, soy, and gluten. It is also free of GMOs, artificial colors, artificial flavors, preservatives, and other additives and fillers."

We use nutrients forms that are most easily absorbed by the body, but because we set dosages to be fully supportive, the nutrient amounts may sometimes be more than you need. At our dosages, this is not harmful in any way, but just a guarantee you hit optimal amounts. Less is not more in our mind!"

We work directly with practitioners who regularly test nutrient levels to select every nutrient form and dose."

Due to higher meat and overall general calorie consumption, they found men to be less deficient than women in a number of key nutrients. Men can take our prenatal multi instead, if they want additional support, but most prefer our 4 capsule tailored version."

              "answer": "Our Men’s Muli is vegetarian, but not vegan. There are considerable sustainability questions around the common vegan source of Vitamin D3, lichen. Lichen is a moss-like organism that exists as a composite of fungus and algae. It is an important part of the Arctic tundra ecosystem and grows \"extremely slowly\", less than a millimeter per year. For this reason, we prefer a “mind-fully made” D3 originally sourced from lanolin. It is allergen free, meaning no milk, egg, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, soy, and gluten. It is also free of GMOs, artificial colors, artificial flavors, preservatives, and other additives and fillers."

              "answer": "It may at times, especially with new consistent use. B Vitamins in particular can cause urine to change to a bright yellow hue. Your body is excreting what it doesn’t need. We use nutrients forms that are most easily absorbed by the body, but because we set dosages to be fully supportive, the nutrient amounts may sometimes be more than you need. At our dosages, this is not harmful in any way, but just a guarantee you hit optimal amounts. Less is not more in our mind!"

We also recommend taking only as much as you need (some women do not need to supplement), as too much supplemental Iron can generate oxidative stress and alter the gut microbiome. Talk to your health practitioner about testing your Iron status, and supplement only if you are falling short. Our Iron is bound to Glycine for better absorption and digestive comfort."

Lichen is a moss-like organism that exists as a composite of fungus and algae. It is an important part of the Arctic tundra ecosystem and grows \"extremely slowly\", less than a millimeter per year. For this reason, we prefer a “mind-fully made” D3 originally sourced from lanolin. It is allergen free, meaning no milk, egg, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, soy, and gluten. It is also free of GMOs, artificial colors, artificial flavors, preservatives, and other additives and fillers."

We use nutrient forms that are most easily absorbed by the body, but because we set dosages to be fully supportive, the nutrient amounts may sometimes be more than you need. At our dosages, this is not harmful in any way, but just a guarantee you hit optimal amounts."
